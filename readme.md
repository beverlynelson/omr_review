#OMR Review

Testing curriculum & tutorials for HS students and RB alumni

##Assessment

* Disclaimer: It's made very clear early on that this is intented to reach a minimum viable product not convert students into software engineers and that's accurate

* Instant Gratification: This reminds me very much of the outcome of  Railsbridge.  Students get exposed to several components of Rails, including heroku, git, etc, and a visual representation of their work live on the web. That spurs curiosity to learn more but certainly attendees are not ready to go it alone. There are lots of shortcuts that should make you want to deep dive into individual topics.

* Don't go it alone: @Rubyfriends if you choose to do this pair up with a more seasoned ruby dev in the group to help you out if you hit a glitch or if there is something you need explained in depth.  There are several places that something could go wrong and I don't wnat you to be frustrated.  
Reach out and ask one of us.

* Timeframe: Total time for me was about 4 hours and I just coded while the video played, I skipped some of the ends of the videos especially at the intro but they would be good for beginners to listen to if you choose to do this. One month should be sufficient to follow along. Railsbridge is usually finished over the course of 1 evening and 1 day so a month is doable.

* What if I want to be a developer?  If you decided to take the course and it interests you, then you need to connect with a Ruby developer or send me a message if you can't find one. If you are looking for a great place to go to learn to become a developer in a relatively short time frame, I can't recommend something like [gschool](http://www.gschool.it/) enough.  

## Should you take this?  Is it worth the money? 

I honestly can't answer that for you and everyone learns differently.  Sorry.  I do like the exposure to different aspects of development you will encounter but for some people this will be overwhelming because of all the new terminology.  I've worked with a lot of beginners at this point and some people really need more of the "why" it works rather than just the fact that it works.  I do like the end result application.  Let me reiterate what he says in the video - There are still many more skills to acquire so this will NOT make you a software engineer, it will give you a taste of the joy that is web development.

If you have the extra $49 sitting around and you want to give it a whirl, go ahead.  If $49 is a stretch get in touch with me or one of the [Ruby Friends](http://www.github.com/rubyfriends/) because we have several free or open source resources to connect you to.
